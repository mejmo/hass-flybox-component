A Home Assistant custom integration for **Orange Flybox** mobile routers. It polls the router's local API to expose network status, data usage, WiFi state, and battery information as Home Assistant entities.

> **Note:** No authentication is required. The router must be accessible on your local network (default gateway `192.168.2.1`).
